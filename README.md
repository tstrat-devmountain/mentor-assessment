## Simple List with Redux-Promise-Middleware

**Problem**: Promises in redux are tricky with their async timings

**Solution**:  Use REDUX - PROMISE - MIDDLEWARE!!!!

## Time recording
Time Started:
    Monday, Nov 26th 8:30pm

Finished Static Redux through regular AXIOS:
    Monday, Nov 26th 11:50 pm

Updating some minor changes and functionality / Testing bugs and fixes:
    Wednesday, Nov 28th 2:30 pm - 3:00 pm

`FINISHED` Converted regular axios to use the middleware:
    Wednesday, Nov 28: 6:30 - 7:45 pm




Styling and CSS:
    Wednesday Nov 28th, 7:45 - 11:00pm (with about an hour break in between);

* Total time to completion of functionality: `4hrs 55min (Monday and Wednesday)` +/- some time for bugfixes after css altering

* Main issue I had with time was not realizing I only did axios and not the promise middleware at first.  After realizing my mistake on Wednesday I redid that section by replacing the axios calls with redux action calls like I was supposed to.
