# React Assessments

<img src="https://github.com/DevMountain/react-assessment/blob/master/readme-assets/1-3.png" />

In the following assessments, we will break down the process of building a to-do list. The to-do list will be capable of creating tasks, deleting tasks, updating tasks, and completing tasks. 

A task should be an object with the following properties: `id`, `title`, `description`, and `completed`.

For assessment 1 and 2 you will be responsible for all functionality besides updating. Also you will only need to worry about `id`, `title` and `completed`. For assessment 3 you will be responsible for all functionality and all properties of a task ( `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed` ).

In all three assessments you will not be graded on CSS. We only ask that you make the display of information clear so that it can be graded properly. The screenshots above are only to help with visualization.

Assessment 3 will use an API to manage tasks. Here is the documentation for that API:

## Assessment 2

### Summary

In this assessment, we will use the repository you made in assessment one and modify the logic. 

### Functionality

* No new functionality is added in this assessment. It should function the same as assessment 1.

### Technical Requirements

* Keep track of tasks using redux.
* Create, Complete, and Delete tasks using action creators with redux.

## Assessment 3

### Summary

In this assessment, we will use the repository you made in assessment two and modify the logic.

You will find the API documation in the first section of this document.

### Functionality

* A user should be able to click on a task to be taken to a detailed view of that task:
  * A user should be able to modify the title of a task.
  * A user should be able to add/modify the description of a task.
  * A user should be able to save changes to a title/description:
    * This should navigate the user to the main list of tasks after saving changes.
  * A user should be able to cancel text changes:
    * This should set the input fields' values back to their original value.
  * A user should be able to delete a task:
    * This should navigate the user back to the main list of tasks after deleting a task.
  * A user should be able to complete a task:
    * This should navigate a user back to the main list of tasks after completeing a task.
* A user should be able to click on a link to be taken back to the main list of tasks from the detailed view.


### Technical Requirements

* Use the API to manage tasks.
* Use `redux-promise-middleware`, `Redux`, and `axios` to create, fetch, update, complete, and delete tasks.
* Use `react-router-dom` to create a new route to a detailed view of a task:
  * This route should use route parameters to know which task it is working with.
  * This route should be able to handle refreshing ( data should not be lost on refresh ).
